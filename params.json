Beautiful...Read on.\r\n\r\n### Intro\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nThe setup I will describe is for Linux (64 bit, Ubuntu). \r\nRequirements:\r\n* **JDK 1.7** (Whichever is required in your class)\r\n* **Eclipse**\r\n* **Nachos code** (Usually in a git repo)\r\n* **C to MIPS cross-compiler binaries** These are used when you compile C programs into binaries which will be read in by the Nachos OS. Since we're using Linux, we do not want to use the ones that are already installed (cpp, cc, as, ld) so we need to install the binaries that are compatible with Nachos.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n### Threads\r\n\r\n### Multi Programming\r\n\r\n### Scheduling\r\n\r\n### File System\r\n\r\n### Virtual Memory\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
